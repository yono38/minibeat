# Chartbeat Front-end Engineering Exercise
## By Jason Schapiro

**See the live version on [minibeat.jasonschapiro.com](http://minibeat.jasonschapiro.com)**

A web app called Minibeat that shows the top ten visited pages
for gizmodo.com, sorted by current visitor number.  Use the provided file
structure as a starting point.  Modify the file structure to what you
think is best.

Each page title in the list (found in the API via `page.title`) should be
preceded by its current visitor number (found via `page.stats.people`).

The list should poll for updates every 5 seconds and update the DOM to reflect
the new data.

When an item in the list is clicked, the right pane should show a list of
its top referers (found via `page.stats.toprefs`).  Each referer should include
its number of visitors (found via `topref.visitors`).

It should be formatted like the following wireframe:

**Rules:**

 * Do not use jQuery or any other frameworks/languages (i.e. use pure JavaScript and CSS).

 * We are interested in how you structure large applications.

 * Do just enough so we can evaluate your understanding of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

 * It should work in modern (HTML5) browsers. Focus on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. IE compatibility is nice but don't spend too much time on it.

**NOTE: You need to fill in a valid chartbeat API key in cbUtils.js to run this yourself!**
